                <h2>
                    Causal vs Correlation:
                </h2>

                <p>
                    We can easily uncover the strong correlation in our datasets, but with a causal lens, these insights can be misleading or dangerous.
                    Let's start with a famous example: "Shark attacks and ice cream sales"
                </p>
                <p>Through observation, we can see that in the summer, the number of shark attacks and ice cream sales rise and fall together.
                    So can we conclude that eating ice cream can summon the sharks? The answer is absolutly no. The real reason for these phenomenon is the high temperature of the summer.
                </p>

                <p>
                   The example sound silly, but it reflect for the "spurious correlation"
                </p>

                <p>
                    In this case, that where the causal play the game.
                </p>

                <p> 
                    Through this series of post, I want to show you some basic concepts about causality. These information that I extract while reading "The book of why" by Judea Pearl

                <h2>
                    Causal Genesis:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In 1889, Francis Galton proposed a new term: "correlation"
                </p>
                <p>After that, the theory around linear regression is formed, and Galton beleived that the causality does not necessary anymore</p>

                <h2>Pearson's story</h2>
                <p>
                    He expresses his view of
causation with great clarity in The Grammar of Science (1892): “That a
certain sequence has occurred and reoccurred in the past is a matter of
experience to which we give expression in the concept causation.... Science
in no case can demonstrate any inherent necessity in a sequence, nor prove
with absolute certainty that it must be repeated.
                </p>
                <p>Pearson was
                    even more dismissive: “the ultimate scientific statement of description of the
                    relation between two things can always be thrown back upon... a contingency
                    table.” In other words, data is all there is to science. Full stop. In this view, the
                    notions of intervention and counterfactuals discussed in Chapter 1 do not
                    exist, and the lowest rung of the Ladder of Causation is all that is needed for
                    doing science.</p>

                <p>Even so, there were cracks in Pearson’s edifice of causality-free science,
                    perhaps even more so among the founders than among the later disciples. For
                    instance, Pearson himself surprisingly wrote several papers about “spurious
                    correlation,” a concept impossible to make sense of without making some
                    reference to causation.
                    Pearson noticed that it’s relatively easy to find correlations that are just
                    plain silly. For instance, for a fun example postdating Pearson’s time, there is
                    a strong correlation between a nation’s per capita chocolate consumption and
                    its number of Nobel Prize winners. This correlation seems silly because we
                    cannot envision any way in which eating chocolate could cause Nobel Prizes.</p>

                <p>Pearson’s students did not all follow in lockstep behind him. Yule, whobroke with Pearson for other reasons, broke with him over this too. Initially
                    he was in the hard-line camp holding that correlations say everything we
                    could ever wish to understand about science. However, he changed his mind
                    to some extent when he needed to explain poverty conditions in London. In
                    1899, he studied the question of whether “out-relief” (that is, welfare
                    delivered to a pauper’s home versus a poorhouse) increased the rate of
                    poverty. The data showed that districts with more out-relief had a higher
                    poverty rate, but Yule realized that the correlation was possibly spurious:
                    these districts might also have more elderly people, who tend to be poorer.
                    However, he then showed that even in comparisons of districts with equal
                    proportions of elderly people, the correlation remained. This emboldened him
                    to say that the increased poverty rate was due to out-relief. But after stepping
                    out of line to make this assertion, he fell back into line again, writing in a
                    footnote, “Strictly speaking, for ‘due to’ read ‘associated with.’” This set the
                    pattern for generations of scientists after him. They would think “due to” and
                    say “associated with.</p>

                <h2>
                    The turning point 
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A significant turning point came when I entered grade 9.
                    After spending years folding models from YouTube tutorials and books, I discovered another valuable resource in my origami journey: crease patterns (CP). 
                    CPs are simplified representations of origami structures, offering a more advanced form of instruction. 
                    While most complex model is so time-cosumming to make a detail tutorial or diagram, create pattern is a good choice to present the structure of model, also a challenge for anyone who want to fold this model. 
                    After years and years folding diagrams, I recognize that every model was the combination of many different structures, and the most simple structure, called traditional bases, can be apply to every model we want. 
                    I have folded many create pattern, also appy the basic base to expand the old model. 
                    Then I recorgnize that we can change a little in the structure and develop the fold in the way we want, to present out own view about this model.
                </p>

                <p>
                    That’s why I found joy in folding, modifying existing models, and exploring my own creative variations.
                </p>

                <p>
                    A year later, as I graduated from secondary school, and move the live in my relative house for the high school. 
                    I also start to use the social media, then connected with more origaminists in Vietnam and around the globe. 
                    Engaging with this community gave me chances to see more and more beautiful models, helped me refine my folding skills, also defined my unique style.
                </p>

                <p>
                    And yeah, I got my first Crumple paper at this time, from that, most of my folds are made of it. However, I just kept a little pictures of them:

                    Yeah, This is the captures of my journey from the beginning to my final year in the high school.
                    After that, I took a break for a while to prepare for an important graduation competition
                </p>

                <p>When I come to the university, and have some really insteresting experience here. But i will tell you later. This post is already so long.</p>

                <p>
                    Finally, I hope you enjoy reading. In the next post, how about introducing some of my favorite origaminists, or delve into the process of folding a specific model. With origami, every model have it own story, and I was just in the beginning to unveil a little of these stories.
