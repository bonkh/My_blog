                    Causality. In this blog, I will introduce to you the causal inference, explore its basic concepts that distinguise it from traditional analytics.

                    Causal Inference

                <p>
                   Causal inference is the method to answer this question: "What is the effect of X on Y?"

                <h2>
                    Causal vs Correlation:
                </h2>

                <p>
                    We can easily uncover the strong correlation in our datasets, but with a causal lens, these insights can be misleading or dangerous.
                    Let's start with a famous example: "Shark attacks and ice cream sales"
                </p>
                <p>Through observation, we can see that in the summer, the number of shark attacks and ice cream sales rise and fall together.
                    So can we conclude that eating ice cream can summon the sharks? The answer is absolutly no. The real reason for these phenomenon is the high temperature of the summer.
                </p>

                <p>
                   The example sound silly, but it reflect for the "spurious correlation"
                </p>

                <p>
                    In this case, that where the causal play the game.
                </p>

                <p> 
                    Through this series of post, I want to show you some basic concepts about causality. These information that I extract while reading "The book of why" by Judea Pearl

                <h2>
                    Causal Genesis:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In 1889, Francis Galton proposed a new term: "correlation"
                </p>
                <p>After that, the theory around linear regression is formed, and Galton beleived that the causality does not necessary anymore</p>
                <p>
                    
                </p>
                <p> But forget about that, let's move to the next part</p>
                <hr>
                

                <h2>
                    The turning point 
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A significant turning point came when I entered grade 9.
                    After spending years folding models from YouTube tutorials and books, I discovered another valuable resource in my origami journey: crease patterns (CP). 
                    CPs are simplified representations of origami structures, offering a more advanced form of instruction. 
                    While most complex model is so time-cosumming to make a detail tutorial or diagram, create pattern is a good choice to present the structure of model, also a challenge for anyone who want to fold this model. 
                    After years and years folding diagrams, I recognize that every model was the combination of many different structures, and the most simple structure, called traditional bases, can be apply to every model we want. 
                    I have folded many create pattern, also appy the basic base to expand the old model. 
                    Then I recorgnize that we can change a little in the structure and develop the fold in the way we want, to present out own view about this model.
                </p>

                <p>
                    That’s why I found joy in folding, modifying existing models, and exploring my own creative variations.
                </p>

                <p>
                    A year later, as I graduated from secondary school, and move the live in my relative house for the high school. 
                    I also start to use the social media, then connected with more origaminists in Vietnam and around the globe. 
                    Engaging with this community gave me chances to see more and more beautiful models, helped me refine my folding skills, also defined my unique style.
                </p>

                <p>
                    And yeah, I got my first Crumple paper at this time, from that, most of my folds are made of it. However, I just kept a little pictures of them:

                    Yeah, This is the captures of my journey from the beginning to my final year in the high school.
                    After that, I took a break for a while to prepare for an important graduation competition
                </p>

                <p>When I come to the university, and have some really insteresting experience here. But i will tell you later. This post is already so long.</p>

                <p>
                    Finally, I hope you enjoy reading. In the next post, how about introducing some of my favorite origaminists, or delve into the process of folding a specific model. With origami, every model have it own story, and I was just in the beginning to unveil a little of these stories.
