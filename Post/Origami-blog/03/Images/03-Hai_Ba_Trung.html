                    the Owl designed by Katsuta Kyohei
                </a> , the model my friend asked me to give her on her last birthday. 
            </p>
            <p>
                This year, she had a new request: Maneki Neko, or simply called the lucky cat.
            </p>
            <p>
                At first, I thought: why didn’t she ask me to fold a dragon? My favorite topic! =))) But it’s okay, there is no problem here. 
                I have folded many cat before.
            </p>

            <hr> 
        
            <h2>The idea</h2>
            <p>
                After researching on the Internet, most of the designs I found were 2D, which definitely wouldn’t capture the spirit I wanted. 
                As a result, I decided I had to create my own cat—something 3D, unique, and more expressive. 
            </p>
            <p>
                However, I had been busy for a while and I left the idea aside until I realized the deadline was coming-only one week left before her birthday! 
                I had to start the project right away. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Yeah, the idea to create my own lucky cat was collasped. Haizz!!! But I also want to create a cat which will present how I think about a lucky cat.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another approach is: Modify an old model to create a new representation. I was quite confidence about this method, I have used it in many models before.

                <br>
                <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 50px;">Okay, let's start.</p>
                

                <br>
                The hardest part of this model was the head. I wanted a 3D-shaped head that was expressive enough to present the emotion of a lucky cat. 
                I immediately thought about Katsuta Kyohei’s models. He has folded many cats, so I investigated some of them.

            <h2>About Katsuta Kyohei</h2>
            <p>
                A little about Katsuta: he is a great designer known for color-change models made from multiple sheets of paper. You can visit his 
                <a href="https://www.instagram.com/katsuta_kyohei/" target="_blank">Instagram</a> and his <a href="https://katsuta-origami.com/" target="_blank">Website</a>

            <blockquote class="highlighted-quote">
                "Neither is better, it's just a matter of preference"
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>
                This philosophy impressed me a lot. Well, instead of arguing about which one is better, 
                we should respect each other's idea and focus on sharping our skills to continuously improve our style.
            </p>

            <p>
                Also, the head is really good, I replicated this design and made some modifications to make it look more like a lucky cat.

            <h2>Creating the Model</h2>
            <p>
                For the body, I have tried a freestyle design starting with a fish base. Here are some drafts I made:
            </p>


            <div class="figure-container">
                <figure class="figure-center">
                    <img src="./Images/draft_1.jpeg" alt="Owl" style="width:300px;">
                    <figcaption>Test fold 1</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <figure class="figure-center">
                    <img src="./Images/draft_2.jpeg" alt="Owl" style="width:300px;">
                    <figcaption>Test fold 2</figcaption>
                </figure>
    
            </div>
            <p>
                After finalizing the drafts, it was time to fold the final model. 
            </p>

            <h2>Preparing the Paper</h2>
            <p>
                The first step was preparing the paper. I made a sheet with red on one side and white on the other side—popular colors for a lucky cat. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Here are the materials I usually use:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Dó paper:</strong> Traditional handmade Vietnamese paper, strong but not hard enough for folding, but after the treatment, it's texture is amazing.</li>
                <li><strong>CMC:</strong> A glue-like liquid to treat the paper and make it firm.</li>
                <li><strong>Brush and colors:</strong> For applying the layers of treatment and color.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                I sprayed the paper on a flat surface and coated a thin layer of CMC using a soft brush. 
                For a stronger and thicker result, I added another layer of paper on top. 
                Then, I applied multiple layers of color, letting the paper dry between each layer.
            </p>
            <p>
                After finishing one side, I turned it over and added the red layer. 
                The entire process took nearly a day—most of the time was spent waiting for the paper to dry.
            </p>

            <h2>Folding the Model</h2>
            <p>
                Once the paper was ready, I began folding the model. And here’s the final result:

            <p>
                Yeah, not bad, I have add a little gold color in the model to highlight some details, also give my cat a gold coin. I hope my cat will like this.
            </p>
            <p>
                I hope you enjoyed this journey of creating the lucky cat. Okay, let's stop here, now I have to package the cat and give it to my friend.
